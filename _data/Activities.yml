  - title: UC VEX U Robotics Club - _University of Cincinnati_
    role: _President, Founder_
    description: In collaboration with other students, including high school robotics alumni, I helped found the University of Cincinnati Vex Robotics Club. The goal of this club is to enrich problem-solving and teamwork skills by forming a team to design, build, program, and document robots that will compete against teams from across the world in the Vex U Robotics Competition. 
    description2: In order to create this club, the executive board got together to create our constitution and bylaws. Events were ran to recruit new members and determine interest In the club. Currently, the club is working on acquiring funds for team registration, tools, and parts.

  - title: Competitive Vex Robotics Team - _Brecksville-Broadview Heights High School_
    role: _Captain, Builder, Programmer, Designer, Strategist_
    description: The Vex Robotics Competition is a program where students from across the world design, build, program, and document robots to compete in challenges. Every year consists of a new competition, meaning that at least once a year you have to create a brand new robot. On top of these skills, teams have to develop match strategies that allow them to win matches.
    description2: Throughout my four years of high school experience, I continued to develop these skills, allowing my team to earn many top awards. I was able to build complex systems with ease while maintaining structural integrity, improve existing programming templates by developing shorthand functions, and create strategies that would allow us to win matches we thought to be unwinnable. See project section Over Under for in depth explanations of these skills in use.
