  - title: Competitive Vex Robotics Team - _Brecksville-Broadview Heights High School_
    role: _Captain, Builder, Programmer, Designer, Strategist_
    description: Competitive robotics consist of many different skill sets. These include design, building, programming, documentation, and strategy. Throughout my four years of high school experience, these skills continued to develop, allowing my team to earn many top awards. I was able to build complex systems with ease while maintaining structural integrity, improve existing programming templates by developing shorthand functions, and create strategies that would allow us to win matches we thought to be unwinable. For more in depth explanations, see Projects section title Over Under.
