  - title: 2002 Volvo S60
    description: A catastrophic oil leak caused my 2002 Volvo S60 to become inoperable. A mechanic shop diagnosed the issue as a failed head gasket and recommended a used engine installation over a complicated and labor-intensive gasket replacement. Personal research indicated that head gasket failure was not a common issue on this engine. After personally completing a partial engine teardown and inspection, I determined that the PCV Breather Box was clogged causing camshaft seal failure. When replacing the camshaft seals, precautions had to be taken. This engine is an interference engine, meaning that the pistons and valves could come into contact if not timed properly, potentially causing total engine failure. To counteract this potential failure, I locked the camshafts into place, ensuring that the engine timing was maintained. Finally, the engine was manually turned to confirm proper engine timing before engine startup.

    description2: Once the car was determined to be fully functional, it needed to be reregistered. However, a small leak in the evaporative emissions system was highlighted due to a check engine light. To fix this, I replaced sections of compromised vacuum hose to ensure a proper seal within the system.

  - title: Lego Robot
    description: In my Engineering Design Thinking II class, we were tasked with making lego robots that could follow a line, pick up and determine contents of a box, and place the box in a location depending on its contents. 
    subtitle: For line tracking capabilities, my robot used two color sensors and a PD loop. The loop would take the sum of both sensors and compare that to the individual sensors. The differnce between the two sensors would then be multiplied by a constant and tell the robot to turn the calculated amount. This process would repeat every few miliseconds for as long as the code was running. In simpler terms, if the left sensor was reading black and the right sensor white, the code would return a value that would turn the robot towards the line and then compare again after finishing the loop.

    subtitle2: After developing line tracking, the robot needed to be able to know when to pick up a box. To do this, a button sensor would detect the box and a simple 2 bar would lift up the box. The code behind this consisted of a P loop to supply power to the motor and a summation of power compared to known values to dermine the contents.

    subtitle3: With working line tracking and weight determination, the last bit of functionality came from an ultrasonic sensor reading markers on the side of the track. Using a counter, the code would look at the value assigned to the contents and what marker number it was at currently to determine if the box should be dropped off in that location.

  - title: Simple Writing Tablet
    description: At the University of Cincinnati all students take a class called Engineering Design Thinking in which they are tasked with developing a product that will help struggling communities. 
    subtitle: My group chose to create a simple writing tablet to help the low literacy rates in the country of Nigeria. We used the design process to create a prototype consisting of a metal frame, sand, and clear polyvinyl chloride. With a stylus, users would write as normal and see their text embossed into the sand and shake to erase. While the prototype may not have worked as well as we would have liked, it was a proof of concept and with more development it could be improved tremendously.

  - title: Over Under
    date: May. 2023 - May. 2024
    heading: _Robot Build_
    description1: The objective of Over Under is to score triballs into goals and to elevate your robot for varying point values. Teams are tasked with documenting the design, build, and programming of their robots and competing against teams from across the world.
    description2: Our robot for the Vex Robotics world championship included 4 main subsystems – the drivetrain, the intake, the wings, and the hang.
    description:
      - The drivetrain consisted of six 600 rpm motors with a gear ratio of 36:48 on 3.25” wheels, providing an output of ~365 rpm. This allowed us to move around the field quickly while being able to push opponents around with minimal risk of burnout.
      - The intake was powered by two 600 rpm motors with a gear ratio of 60:36, providing an output of 1000 rpm. The speed combined with the wide opening allowed the robot to easily collect triballs from around the field and score efficiently. A one-way trapdoor allowed us to load triballs through the top while still letting them sit where we wanted inside the robot.
      - The wings were powered with one pneumatic piston each, allowing us to manipulate numerous numbers of triballs in different ways.
      - To elevate the robot, two pistons would activate and fold out a two-stage lift that would slot into the climbing post. When fully aligned, a piston would push two gears in line with the drivetrain allowing the hang to utilize all six drivetrain motors to winch the trays back into position, lifting the robot ~3 feet into the air. This mechanism proved to be crucial in how well we performed at the competition and saw no mechanical issues over its many matches.

    heading2: _Coding_
    description4: Matches consist of two main periods – the autonomous period and the driver control period. Since coding and tuning autonomous routines can be time consuming, I developed short-hand statements that streamlined the process and improved the readability of full-length codes. These short-hand statements allowed for complex autonomous routines to be created in minutes, allowing for more time spent tuning rather than writing.

    heading3: _Strategy_
    description5: The driver control period is heavily influenced by strategy. In this game, my team helped spearhead the change in strategy from shooting triballs across the field to carrying them across the field one by one. In scenarios where an opposing robot was driving towards you with large amounts of triballs you would try to prevent them from scoring them by either pushing them out of play or stealing them for your use. In the last ten seconds of the match you would try to hang as quickly as possible.

    heading4: _Documentation_
    description6: Another part of the Vex Robotics Competition was jusdged awards. To earn these awards students had to fully document their design process and explain it in interviews. Linked [here](https://tinyurl.com/CameronMolina) is the notebook from my senior year.
