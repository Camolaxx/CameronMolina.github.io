    description: 
    A large oil leak caused this car to sit in a warehouse for 2.5 years, with the issue being diagnosed as a head gasket failure that was not worth fixing. Research showed that oil loeaks are common on this model car. However, issues normally stem from the PCV Breather box and camshaft seals rather than the head gasket. After opening the engine bay in Sep. 2025 and removing the PCV Breather box, it appeared that was the issue. In order to replace the camshaft seals though, some precautions needed to be taken. If the timing of the engine was not redone properly, the pistons and valves would collide causing total engine failure. To combat this, a lock was placed on both the intake and exhaust camshaft to ensure that they ratined the correct positioning when the timing belt was replaced. In order to be able to drive the car daily, however, the ohio state emissions test needed to be passed. A check engine light highlighted a small leak in the evaporative emissions system, meaning that that car could not pass. To remedy this, sections of old vaccuum tubing was replaced to ensure proper seals. engine could sieze and all work would be for nothing. To start, the exhaust and intake camshafts were locked into place, followed by the removal of the old seals. A specialty tool was used to ensure a proper seal, and then the engine could be retimed. After placing the belt back onto the pulleys, the system had to be hand cranked for a handful of rotations to ensure that the timing was set properly. Once this was ensured, the engine was fully rebuilt and the car was ready to be tested. It struggled to find life after sitting for so long but with the help of some started fluid it roared to life. However, in order to be a daily driver the car would have to pass an emissions check so that it could be re-registered. Unfortunatley, a check engine light showed up revealing that there was a leak in the evaporative emissions system, meaning we could not pass the e-check. To clear this light, the purge valve and many different spans of vaccuum tubing was replaced to ensure a seal on the system.

  - title: Lego Robot
    description: In Engineering Design Thinking II students were tasked with making lego robots that could follow a line, pick up and determine contents of a box, and place box in a location depending on its contents. 
    subtitle: For line tracking capabilities, my robot used two color sensors and a PD loop. The loop would take the sum of both sensors and compare that to the individual sensors. If the left sensor was reading black and the right white, the code would return a value that would turn the robot towards the line and then compare again after finish that run through of the loop.

    subtitle2: After developing line tracking, the robot needed to be able to know when it is in front of a box and pick it up. To do this, a button sensor was used to detect the box, and a simple 2 bar would lift up the box. The code behind this consisted of a P loop to supply power to the motor, and a summation of power compared to known values to dermine the contents.

    subtitle3: With working line tracking and weight determination, the last bit of functionality came from an ultrasonic sensor reading markers on the side of the track. Using a counter, the code would look at the value assigned to the contents and what marker number it was at to determine if the box should be dropped off in that location.

  - title: Simple Writing Tablet
    description: At the University of Cincinnati all students take a class called Engineering Design Thinking in which they are tasked with developing a product that will help struggling communities. 
    subtitle: My group chose to create a simple writing tablet to help the low literacy rates in the country of Nigeria. We used the design process to create a prototype consisting of a metal frame, sand, and clear polyvinyl chloride. To use the tablet, you would take a stylus and write as normal and see your writing in the sand. To erase your writing you would shake until the sand flattened. While the prototype may not have worked as well as we would have liked, it was a proof of concept and with more development it could be improved tremendously.
