    description: A catastrophic oil leak caused the car to become inoperable. A mechanic shop diagnosed the issue as a failed head gasket and recommended a used engine installation over a complicated and labor-intensive gasket replacement. Personal research indicated that head gasket failure was not a common issue on this engine. After personally completing a partial engine teardown and inspection, it was determined that the PCV Breather Box was clogged causing camshaft seal failure. When replacing the camshaft seals, precautions needed to be taken. This engine is an interference engine, meaning that the pistons and valves could come into contact if not timed properly, potentially causing total engine failure. To counteract this potential failure, the camshafts were locked into place to ensure the engine timing was maintained. The engine was manually turned to confirm proper engine timing before engine startup.

    description2: Once the car was determined to be fully functional, it needed to be reregistered. However, a small leak in the evaporative emissions system was highlighted due to a check engine light. To fix this, sections of compromised vacuum hose were replaced to ensure a proper seal within the system.

  - title: Lego Robot
    description: In Engineering Design Thinking II students were tasked with making lego robots that could follow a line, pick up and determine contents of a box, and place box in a location depending on its contents. 
    subtitle: For line tracking capabilities, my robot used two color sensors and a PD loop. The loop would take the sum of both sensors and compare that to the individual sensors. If the left sensor was reading black and the right white, the code would return a value that would turn the robot towards the line and then compare again after finish that run through of the loop.

    subtitle2: After developing line tracking, the robot needed to be able to know when it is in front of a box and pick it up. To do this, a button sensor was used to detect the box, and a simple 2 bar would lift up the box. The code behind this consisted of a P loop to supply power to the motor, and a summation of power compared to known values to dermine the contents.

    subtitle3: With working line tracking and weight determination, the last bit of functionality came from an ultrasonic sensor reading markers on the side of the track. Using a counter, the code would look at the value assigned to the contents and what marker number it was at to determine if the box should be dropped off in that location.

  - title: Simple Writing Tablet
    description: At the University of Cincinnati all students take a class called Engineering Design Thinking in which they are tasked with developing a product that will help struggling communities. 
    subtitle: My group chose to create a simple writing tablet to help the low literacy rates in the country of Nigeria. We used the design process to create a prototype consisting of a metal frame, sand, and clear polyvinyl chloride. To use the tablet, you would take a stylus and write as normal and see your writing in the sand. To erase your writing you would shake until the sand flattened. While the prototype may not have worked as well as we would have liked, it was a proof of concept and with more development it could be improved tremendously.

  - title: Over Under
    date: May. 2023 - May. 2024
    subtitle: __Robot Build__
    description: The objective of Over Under is to score triballs into goals and to elevate your robot for varying point values. Teams are tasked with documenting the design, build, and programming of their robots and competing against teams from across the world.
    description2: Our robot for the Vex Robotics world championship included 4 main subsystems – the drivetrain, the intake, the wings, and the hang.
    -	The drivetrain consisted of six 600 rpm motors with a gear ratio of 36:48 on 3.25” wheels, providing an output of ~365 rpm. This allowed us to move around the field quickly while being able to push opponents around with minimal risk of burnout.
    -	The intake was powered by two 600 rpm motors with a gear ratio of 60:36, providing an output of 1000 rpm. The speed combined with the wide opening allowed the robot to easily collect triballs from around the field and score efficiently. A one-way trapdoor allowed us to load triballs through the top while still letting them sit where we wanted inside the robot.
    -	The wings were powered with one pneumatic piston each, allowing us to manipulate numerous numbers of triballs in different ways.
    -	To elevate the robot, two pistons would activate and fold out a two-stage lift that would slot into the climbing post. When fully aligned, a piston would push two gears in line with the drivetrain allowing the hang to utilize all six drivetrain motors to winch the trays back into position, lifting the robot ~3 feet into the air. This mechanism proved to be crucial in how well we performed at the competition and saw no mechanical issues over its many matches.

    heading: __Coding__
    description3: Matches consist of two main periods – the autonomous period and the driver control period. Since coding and tuning autonomous routines can be time consuming, I developed short-hand statements that streamlined the process and improved the readability of full-length codes. These short-hand statements allowed for complex autonomous routines to be created in minutes, allowing for more time spent tuning rather than writing.
