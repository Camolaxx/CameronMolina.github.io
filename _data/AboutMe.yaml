  - subtitle: My name is Cameron Molina and I am a second year undergraduate at the University of Cincinnati. After starting in Civil Engineering and completing my first Co-op at GPD Group in Akron, Ohio, I decided to switch majors. Having been a part of competitive robotics for 6+ years and missing the satisfaction that it gave me I decided to switch to Mechanical Engineering. I recently started the University of Cincinnati Vex U Robotics Club and hope to help it grow into a competitive collegiate team while also building lasting relationships with its members. Contact information and links to my LinkedIn, Github, and resume can be found at the bottom of this page.
